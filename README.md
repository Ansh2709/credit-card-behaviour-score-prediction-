## 🔍 Key Findings

### 📊 Critical Risk Factors (in order of importance)
1. **Payment Delay History** (`pay_0`, `pay_2`) - Most predictive feature
2. **Credit Utilization Ratio** - High utilization indicates stress
3. **Payment Consistency** - Irregular payment patterns
4. **Bill-to-Payment Ratio** - Payment adequacy indicator
5. **Credit Limit** - Higher limits correlate with lower default rates

### 🎯 Business Insights
- **Payment Behavior**: Recent payment delays are strongest default predictors
- **Credit Management**: Customers with high utilization (>80%) show 3x higher default risk
- **Demographic Patterns**: Age and education level significantly influence default probability
- **Seasonal Trends**: Payment patterns vary by month, indicating cash flow cycles
